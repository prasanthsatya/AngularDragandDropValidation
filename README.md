# AngularDragandDropValidation
My first angular drag and drop validation

I have written a code for drag and drop validation. In this the output is like circle images should only drop to circle box and triangle should only drop in to triangle box. If you try to drop the circle image into triangle box and vice versa it should revert back to the original place without dropping.
We have achieved this using dragular.js external API. The reverting part of this activity was done manually as we couldn't find any property in the dragular API.

Plase help me to achive this in otherway around.
